  <h3 style="text-align:center;">ABOUT US</h3>
  <p>“Well Done” was a concept at first, alive only in the thoughts of Emily, Sanika, Ryaan, and Lyon
	while they were slaving away at “Jess’ OK BBQ” in Dallas, TX. After years of fooling customers
	into thinking that the plastic they were eating was really meat, the four decided that they’d had
	enough and unexpectedly decided to fly to Iceland. Why Iceland? The four wanted to see whether
	it was actually cold. After being stranded in the Keflavik Airport with nothing to their names
	but a pair of loafers, the four hitched a ride through a Chinese sewer tour to end up in Hafnarfjordur.
	There, the four found that the Korean BBQ market was thoroughly empty. The rest is history.
	Since 2003, “Well Done” has been Iceland’s finest KBBQ establishment and has emerged as a major
	tourist attraction to travelers from across the world.
