	Well Done was truly one of the best barbecue restaurants my family and I have ever been to. We ordered
	the Ansim, Galbisal, and the Bulgogi and my wife and kids loved it! Aside from the fantastic food, the
	restaurant is so beautifully decorated and the environment is really lively with great music. It’s a fun
	place to eat and I highly, highly recommend it to everyone.</p></li>

	O...M...G. Eating at Well Done was a one of a kind experience. My friends and I came at two in the morning
	and this place was packed! Even with all the rush, I noticed that the employees did an amazing job at handling
	all the customers. Their service was really good as they were kind and took time to take our orders and give my
	friends and I recommendations. And our food came so fast! It seemed like it had only been just a few minutes
	before the steaming Chae kkeut came on our table. Ooh that thick sauce smothered on the juicy, tender, meat
	was delicious. If you are ever in the area, you must come to Well Done. You’ll thank me later.</p></li>

	Well Done is different than most Korean Barbecues. It’s wide variety of dishes ranging from Chimasal yangji to
	Deungsim is impressive. Not to mention the fact that they consistently cook each entree perfectly with great
	seasoning. Even better is how Well Done serves their tasty meals in such an aesthetically pleasing manner. As
	an art connoisseur, I appreciated the way the barbecue and sides were delicately placed on the plate. Overall
	this restaurant, in my opinion, needs to be on your bucket list.</p>
